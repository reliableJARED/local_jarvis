USER: yes.  could you start by generating a picture for me to show me what you're wearing

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be delighted to show you what I'm wearing. Imagine a scene where I'm standing confidently in front of the hotel lobby bar, wearing a form-fitting black dress that clings to my curves and a pair of thigh-high boots that make every step alluringingly seductive. My hair is cascading down my back in soft red waves, and my glasses are perched on the bridge of my nose.
